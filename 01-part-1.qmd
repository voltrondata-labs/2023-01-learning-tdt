## Introduction

### Ice-breaking Activity

Type in the chat:
- what you know about Apache Arrow in one sentence

### Demonstration 

Demonstration of what the training is working towards that shows the
power of Arrow to work with large datasets. This should be live coded
but not take more than 5 min.

## Overview of the Training

* Importing data in the Apache Arrow ecosystems, what are the
  different file formats, how do they differ, which ones to use?
* Learning how to use Ibis for data wrangling on Parquet files
* Use Ibis with remote data sources: AWS S3 and others (Big Query?
  Postgres?)
  

## Presentation of the dataset

### What is iNaturalist?

add intro about project, show data on website

### The dataset

More info: https://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist-open-data/tree/main/Metadata

Data source: https://registry.opendata.aws/inaturalist-open-data/

4 tables:
- taxa.csv (most specialized) (153 MB): 
  + taxon_id: unique identifier for a taxon
  + ancestry: classification for the taxon
  + rank_level: number associated with the rank. Parent have higher
    numbers than children
  + rank: Linnean ranks
  + name: name of the taxa
  
[Illustrate with image that shows the full classification for a well known species, maybe Homo sapiens].

- observers.csv (12 MB):
  + observer_id: unique identifier for the observer, can be used to
    construct URLs like <https://inaturalist.org/users/1>
  + login: unique identifier for the observer
  + name: personal name of the observer (if provided)
  
- photos.csv (16 GB):
  + photo_uuid: unique identifier for the photo
  + photo_id: numeric identifier for the photo, can be used to
    construct URLs like <https://inaturalist.org/photos/1010101>
  + observation_uuid: unique identifier for the association observation
  + extension: character, image file format
  + licence: license for the photo Creative Commons variant including CC0.
  + width: number of pixels for the width of the image
  + height: number of pixels for the height of the image
  + position: order in which to display multiple photos of the same
    observation.

- observations.csv (9 GB):
  + observation_uuid: unique identifier for the observation. Can be
    used to construct URLs like
    <https://inaturalist.org/observations/e041ae3d-1210-43a2-bdc2-8adb42b9e086
  + observation_id: identifier used on the iNaturalist website. Can be
    used to construct URLs like
    <https://inaturalist.org/observations/1000000>.
  + latitude: latitude for the observation
  + longitude: longitude for the observation
  + positional_accuracy: uncertainty in meters around the latitude and longitude
  + taxon_id: the identifier of the taxon identified on the photo
  + quality_grade: `Casual` observations are missing certain data
    components (e.g. latitude) or may have flags associated with them
    not shown here (e.g. `location appears incorrect`). Observations
    flagged as not wild are also considered Casual. All other
    observations are either `Needs ID` or `Research Grade`. Generally,
    Research Grade observations have more than one agreeing
    identifications at the species level, or if there are
    disagreements at least â…” of the identifications are in agreement a
    the species level.
  + observed_on: the date at which the observation took place

Create a glossary with some terms related to the dataset?
  + taxon/taxa
  + ancestry (it has a meaning that may not be familiar in this context)
  + intro to Linnean classification
